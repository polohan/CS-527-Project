Tests run: 16, Failures: 1, Errors: 6, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.268 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.biojava.nbio.core.sequence.loader.GenbankProxySequenceReaderTest","The test failure from Pacific/Chatham, Pacific/Chatham-DST are proved to originated from the fact that the system time is mocked to an date in the past, not because the timezone.

And for the test failures in ""UTC"" timezone, such errors did occur in later manual rerun, but it turns out that when the tests are ran with just UTC (without faking time), the tests show the exact result as sample runs. But, if ran in UTC with libfaketime (even though it's not actually faking the time), the test will fail.","Need to add tests to see how the code behave when it's a date in the past/future. Some potential dates to mock include 1 min/hour/day/week/month/year in the past/future.

And for some reason, libfaketime and UTC timezone doesn't work well together. Might need further investigation."
